    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB (and NULL)\n",
    "Other types of data can be used by custom conversion.\n",
    "From sqlite3 documentation: \"If you want to use other types you must add support for them yourself. The detect_types parameter and the using custom converters registered with the module-level register_converter() function allow you to easily do that.\" (https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Primary Keys are the indexing variable, which is the unique identifier for each data point. Foreign Keys are the primary keys from other table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "In terms of cardinalities, there's one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. There are also unary/recursive relationship and ternary relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Inner Join - keeps only the overlaps\n",
    "Full Outer Join - keeps everything\n",
    "Left (Outer) Join - keeps everything from the first table and overlaps but drops items unique to the second table.\n",
    "Right (Outer) Join - keeps everything from the second table and overlaps but drops items unique to the first table.\n",
    "Left Antijoin - keeps everything from the first table except ones that matches the second table\n",
    "Right Antijoin - keeps everything from the second table except ones that matches the first table \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate function 'aggregates' data to perform a calculation. GROUP BY statement provides information to base such aggregation on. If we want the sum of individual groups, calculating the sum of individual groups is the role of aggregate, while deciding how to divide each group is the role of GROUP BY.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associate Entities works as a junction between tables. It makes an association between different primary keys from different tables so to connect otherwise separate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
